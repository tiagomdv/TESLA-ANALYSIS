Tesla has been fast growing its operations by sucessful scaling and broadening its offer to the customer, creating an unmatched ecosystem that brings great value.
For years it has been innovating its technology and is now on the cusp of an exponential growth by leveraging 3 ready to market technology platforms: Robotics, Battery Technology and Artifial Intelligence. It will greatly decrease its costs by Wright´s Law estimates in this next decade and increase its TAM (Total Adressable Market) opportunity with great competitive advantage by cost and differentiation. 


I have been a Tesla investor since 2018 and I´ve been using simpler own made models to study the company. This project is to create a more robust set of models where I can more easily model different scenarios in a more professional way.
